# Lab 6: C++ Relations (Polymorphism)

## Objectives:

- Learn about C++ Relations (Polymorphism).
- Learn about C++ Inheritance types.

## Tasks:

1. Make a `calculateSum` method with `Polymorphism`.

2. Make a `GeoShape` class and test `Inheritance types`.

3. Make a `Picture` class with `Polymorphism`.

## Notes:

- You can build (compile) the lab using

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp -lSDL2.
```

- Run it with

```bash
./main
```
